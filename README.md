# WiDs-Dathathon-2023

In advance of the Women in Data Science (WiDS) Stanford Conference to be held on March 8, 2023, we build a team, hone our data science skills, and joined for  6th Annual WiDS Datathon focused on social impact.
In this yearâ€™s datathon challenges we will use data science to improve longer-range weather forecasts to help people prepare and adapt to extreme weather events caused by climate change.
